  In order to use IntegrityAdvocate acivity restriction
  As a teacher or as a student

  Scenario: Activity completion on quiz1 should prevent access to page1
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on

    # Restrict page1 to require quiz1 IA completion.
    When I open "Page1" actions menu
    And I click on "Edit settings" "link" in the "Page1" activity
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I click on "Add restriction..." "button"
    And I click on "Integrity Advocate" "button" in the "Add restriction..." "dialogue"
    # And I click on "Displayed if student doesn't meet this condition â€¢ Click to hide" "link"
    # In newer versions this field is named "Activity or resource"
    And I set the field "Module" to "Quiz 1"
    And I set the field "Required IA validation status" to "must have IA status valid"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    Then I should see "Not available unless: The IA result for module Quiz 1 is valid" in the "region-main" "region"
    When I turn editing mode off
    Then I should see "Not available unless: The IA result for module Quiz 1 is valid" in the "region-main" "region"

# Todo: Test this
  # And I set the field "Module" to "Quiz1"
  # And I set the field "Required IA validation status" to "Must have IA status invalid"

# Todo: Test this maybe?
  # On Page1 require IA completion status=invalid in Quiz 1
  # As a student I can access Page1
